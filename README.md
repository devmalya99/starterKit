🛠️ Setup Guide
Prerequisites
Node.js (v18+ recommended)

MongoDB Atlas account or local MongoDB instance

Git (optional)

🖥️ Backend Setup
Navigate to server directory

bash
Copy
cd server
Create environment file

bash
Copy
touch .env
Add these variables to .env (replace with your values):

env
Copy
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret_key
PORT=8200
Install dependencies

bash
Copy
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
Start the server

bash
Copy
npm run start
✅ Server should now be running on http://localhost:8200

💻 Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal and navigate to client directory

bash
Copy
cd client
Create environment file

bash
Copy
touch .env
Add this variable to .env:

env
Copy
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8200
Install dependencies

bash
Copy
npm install
Start the development server

bash
Copy
npm run dev
🌐 Client should now be running (check terminal for exact port, typically 5173)

🚀 Getting Started with Development
Clone the repository (if you haven't already)

bash
Copy
git clone your-repo-url
Install dependencies for both client and server (as shown above)

Start both servers in separate terminals:

Server: npm run start (from /server)

Client: npm run dev (from /client)

Begin coding! The template includes:

Basic user authentication routes

React context setup

API service examples

Responsive layout starter

💡 Pro Tips
Use npm install --legacy-peer-deps if you encounter peer dependency issues

For MongoDB, we recommend MongoDB Atlas for a free cloud database

Customize the .env files with your own secure values

The server runs on port 8200 by default, change in .env if needed
